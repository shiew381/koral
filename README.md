# What is Koral?

Koral is a learning management system system designed for instructors to create and distribute their own educational content.
A live instance of this repository can be found on the web at https://koral.community

# Who built Koral?
Koral was built by STEM educators and software developers, but is intended for use by institutions, teachers, and students everywhere. The project is supported by generous funding from California Learning Lab (https://calearninglab.org/)

# Which programming framework was used?
The Koral code base is written using node.js and React. Additionally, the application interacts with firebase (https://firebase.google.com), which provides cloud authentication, no-SQL database, and file storage services.

# Steps for getting started.
1. If you intend to run your instance, you'll need to open your own firebase project (https://firebase.google.com/).
2. Add a .env file to your root directory with your firebase configuration and style customizations. The file .env.koral-example is provided as a guide.
3. Run npm install.
